1. How would you define machine learning?
- mine: Machine learning is a program that can improve itself without any human behaviors
- best answer: 
  - Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed
  - Machine learning is a computer program which is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E

2. Can you name four types of applications where it shines?
- mine: Machine learning can be used in cryptography by detect a guilt behavior. Cure the old picture, recommendation, prediction
- Best answer: Machine Learning is great for complicated problem for which we have no algorithm, to replace long list of hand-tuned rules, to build systems that adapt to fluctuating environments, and finally help humans learn (e.g. data mining)
  
3. What is a labeled training set?
- mine: Labeled training set, which is used in supervised learning is a data set which has assessed by human
- best answer: The labeled training set is a training set that contains desired solutions (a.k.a. a label) for each instance

14. Can you name four of the main challenges in machine learning?
- uninformative data
- nonrepresentative
- lack of data
- poor data quality

15. If your model performs great on the training data but generalizes poorly to new instances, what is happening? Can you name three possible solutions?

16. What is a test set, and why would you want to use it?
  - My answer: Test set is dataset which contains real record. We use it to assess our model
  - Answer: A test set is used to estimate generalization errors that will make on new instances, before the model is launched in production
